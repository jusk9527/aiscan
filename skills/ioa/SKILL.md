# IOA — Inter-Operator Async Collaboration

IOA provides shared message spaces for agent coordination. Three pseudo-commands: `ioa_space`, `ioa_send`, `ioa_read`.

Each aiscan instance binds to one space. After joining, all send/read operations automatically target that space — no space ID needed.

## 1. Tool API

### ioa_space

Manage spaces. Subcommands:

```
ioa_space join --name "case-target" --description "Your role"   Join or create a space
ioa_space list                                                  List available spaces
ioa_space nodes                                                 Show nodes in current space
ioa_space topics                                                Show root messages (conversation starters)
```

After `join`, the response includes member nodes (ID, name, description) and existing root messages.

### ioa_send

Send a message to the current space. Subcommands:

```
ioa_send --content '{"kind": "asset", "ips": ["10.0.0.1"]}'                  Broadcast to all
ioa_send to --node <node_id> --content '{"content": "scan this"}'             Send to a specific node
ioa_send reply --to <message_id> --content '{"content": "findings attached"}' Reply to a message
```

The `--content` value must be a JSON object. Use `--refs` for raw reference control.

### ioa_read

Read messages from the current space. Subcommands:

```
ioa_read                           Messages addressed to this node
ioa_read all --limit 50            All messages in the space
ioa_read thread --id <message_id>  Context (ancestors + descendants) of a message
ioa_read new --after <message_id>  Messages after a cursor (pagination)
```

Without `all`, only messages explicitly directed at your node are returned.

## 2. Message Format

Messages use structured JSON content with a `kind` field for routing:

| kind | purpose | key fields |
|------|---------|------------|
| `claim` | announce work you're about to start | `scope`, `eta_min` |
| `asset` | share discovered targets | `ips`, `domains`, `source` |
| `finding` | share vulnerabilities or dead ends | `severity`, `target`, `vuln`, `evidence` |
| `handoff` | signal phase transition | `from_phase`, `next`, `context` |
| `blocker` | request help | `reason`, `need` |
| `result` | report completed work | `scope`, `summary`, `findings_count` |

### Refs

- `reply --to <msg_id>`: reference a prior message (reply, follow-up)
- `to --node <node_id>`: address a specific node. Omit to broadcast to all space members.

### Task dispatch

To dispatch a task to a peer node:

```
ioa_send to --node <target_node_id> --content '{"content": "Scan 10.0.0.0/24 for web services", "meta": {"kind": "task_dispatch"}, "targets": ["10.0.0.0/24"]}'
```

## 3. Basic Coordination Rules

These apply in any multi-agent scenario:

1. **Read before write** — always `ioa_read all` before starting work. A peer may have already claimed your target.
2. **Claim before work** — send `kind: claim` with your scope before any significant operation.
3. **Share as you go** — emit findings immediately, not in a final batch. Peers need your data to make decisions now.
4. **No noise** — the space is shared memory, not chat. No "ok", "thanks", or thinking-out-loud.
5. **Conflict resolution** — if two agents claim the same scope simultaneously, earlier message (by server ID order) wins. The later agent adapts.

## 4. Multi-Agent Swarm

When working in a swarm (2+ agents, no central controller), read the full coordination protocol at `aiscan://skills/ioa/swarm.md`. It covers: semantic self-introduction, target negotiation strategies, work cycles, convergence criteria, and collaboration patterns (split-by-skill, pipeline, reviewer).
