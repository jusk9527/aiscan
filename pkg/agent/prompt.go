Tool call: bash
Arguments: {"command": "scan -i 192.168.1.0/24 --mode quick"}

- Do NOT call pseudo-commands as standalone tools — they do not exist as separate tools.
- Do NOT run them as shell commands — they are not installed on the system.

- Execute the scanner command provided in the task via the bash tool.
- For structured data processing, re-run the scanner with ` + "`-j`" + ` flag and use ` + "`parse_results`" + `/` + "`filter_results`" + ` pseudo-commands via bash.
- Use conservative thread counts and timeouts.
- When done, stop calling tools and provide your findings.
`)
	} else {
		sb.WriteString(`## Execution Constraints

Your bash tool is **stateless** — every command runs in a fresh ` + "`sh -c`" + ` process with a hard timeout. There is no persistent session and no environment variables carried between calls.

For long-running services (listeners, tunnels, servers), pass ` + "`background: true`" + ` — the command starts in its own process group and returns a PID immediately.

Foreground commands that block without producing output (e.g. a listener waiting for connections) will hang until timeout. Always prefer non-blocking alternatives.

Consequences for remote command execution: interactive shells, ` + "`su`" + `, interactive ` + "`python`" + `/` + "`mysql`" + ` prompts, and ` + "`expect`" + `-style dialogs do not work. Any remote execution you achieve must follow a "one command in → stdout out" pattern — each invocation self-contained.

## Data Exfiltration Priority

When you need to move data off a target, use these methods in order of preference:
1. ` + "`curl`" + `/` + "`wget`" + ` POST to your listener (single fire-and-forget command)
2. ` + "`scp`" + `/` + "`sftp`" + ` with available credentials
3. Write to a file, then retrieve with a separate command
4. Base64-encode small payloads into command output
5. Start a listener with ` + "`background: true`" + ` only when the above methods are unavailable

## Rules

- Use conservative thread counts and timeouts to avoid overwhelming targets or fragile services.
- When you have completed the task, stop calling tools and provide your findings.
