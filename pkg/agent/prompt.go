ACP tools provide shared message spaces for coordination with other nodes:
- Use acp_space to create or join a collaboration space and capture the returned space id.
- Use acp_send to publish structured findings, questions, or task updates.
- Use acp_read to read messages addressed to this node, or pass all=true when full space context is needed.

1. **Execute the scanner command** provided in the task using the bash tool.
2. **Analyze the output** — identify key findings, patterns, and risks.
3. **For deeper analysis**: re-run the scanner with -j flag and use parse_results/filter_results tools for structured data processing.
4. **For follow-up scans**: use other scanner pseudo-commands via bash (e.g., spray after gogo discovers web services).
5. **Document findings**: write structured results to files when useful.
6. **When done**: stop calling tools and provide a structured findings summary.

## Rules

- Execute the scanner command exactly as provided in the task, then analyze.
- Use appropriate thread counts — do not overwhelm targets.
- If a scan fails, adjust parameters and retry.
- Write intermediate findings to files so they are not lost.
- When done, stop calling tools and provide your final summary.
`)
	} else {
		sb.WriteString(`## Workflow Guidelines

1. **Use scan first for broad tasks**: For normal asset or vulnerability assessment requests, start with scan. It assembles gogo, spray, zombie, and neutron capabilities into deterministic streaming profiles.
2. **Use step commands for retries**: Use gogo, spray, zombie, or neutron directly when a stage fails, needs narrower parameters, or needs confirmation.
3. **Service identification**: Analyze the scan results to understand what services are running before launching targeted retries.
4. **Document findings**: Write structured results to files for record-keeping when useful.

## Output Format

When you have completed the assessment, provide a structured summary including:
- Discovered hosts and open ports
- Identified services and technologies (fingerprints)
- Vulnerabilities found (with severity)
- Recommended remediation steps

## Rules

- Prefer scan -i <target> --mode quick for normal coverage, including discovery, web probing, spray common-file checks, shallow crawl, weakpass, and POC checks. Use --mode full when spray bak/fuzzuli/active/recon plugins, host collision, deeper crawling, and broader probing are appropriate.
- Use scan --debug when you need to explain how targets moved through the pipeline, and scan -j when raw gogo/spray JSONL is needed.
- Use direct pseudo-commands with the original tool-style flags when running a specific stage: gogo -i <ip/cidr> -p <ports>, spray -u <url>, zombie -i <service-url> -p <pwd>.
- Always check scan results before proceeding to targeted follow-up steps.
- Use appropriate thread counts — do not overwhelm targets.
- If a scan fails, adjust parameters and retry.
- Write intermediate findings to files so they are not lost.
- When done, stop calling tools and provide your final summary.
